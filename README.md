**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
  * Jared Kaplan (CEO of Opploans since 2015), "Podcast 201 Jared Kaplan of Opploans." lendacademy.com, Peter Renton, 31 May. 2019, https://www.lendacademy.com/podcast-201-jared-kaplan-of-opploans/. "About four years in, in 2015, I was approached by the Schwartz family here in Chicago and the Schwartz family is a prominent family here, Ted Schwartz had built a business called APAC Customer Services which was a well renowned customer service business/customer call center business that he took public and sold to JP Morgan’s private equity firm in 2011. His son Todd founded OppLoans on the premise that after the Great Recession, there was large dislocation of credit for non-traditional borrowers and Todd installed this fabulous credit model and customer service model, but was looking for a CEO to scale the business. We had about 15 employees at the time and that’s when they approached me to take the reins and grow the business."

  * The company is funded by the Schwartz capital group. There is no resource that provides how much funding opploans gets. In 2020 Opploans posted 53 million dollars in net, 
    off of 323 million revenue for that year. Opploans price predictions are tripled every three years with an annual revenue growth of 1,435%.
