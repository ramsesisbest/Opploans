## Overview and Origin

**Name of company**
  * Opploans

**Incorporation date**
  * Founded in 2012

**Founder**
  * Todd Schwartz (Schwartz Capital)

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
  * Jared Kaplan (CEO of Opploans since 2015), "Podcast 201 Jared Kaplan of Opploans." lendacademy.com, Peter Renton, 31 May. 2019, https://www.lendacademy.com/podcast-201-jared-kaplan-of-opploans/. "About four years in, in 2015, I was approached by the Schwartz family here in Chicago and the Schwartz family is a prominent family here, Ted Schwartz had built a business called APAC Customer Services which was a well renowned customer service business/customer call center business that he took public and sold to JP Morgan’s private equity firm in 2011. His son Todd founded OppLoans on the premise that after the Great Recession, there was large dislocation of credit for non-traditional borrowers and Todd installed this fabulous credit model and customer service model, but was looking for a CEO to scale the business. We had about 15 employees at the time and that’s when they approached me to take the reins and grow the business."

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
  * The company is funded by the Schwartz capital group. There is no resource that provides how much funding opploans gets. In 2020 Opploans posted 53 million dollars in net, 
    off of 323 million revenue for that year. Opploans price predictions are tripled every three years with an annual revenue growth of 1,435%.


## Business Activities:
**Solving the problem**
  * The premise of the company is to help middle-class income earners with bad credit (not paying bills on time/owe money to financial institutions), because conventional
    and long-established financial conservatories (banks) were/are not. (Opploans is a high interest short term lending company)

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
 * The company's intended customer is borrowers with bad credit. The underserved (Do not have a bank account or do not have access to traditional finacial services) spending market in 2018 hit a revenue marker of 188.5 billion. Short-term credit spending in 2018 hit 66.1 billion (Opploans is a short term credit borrowing lender). Opploans does not charge origination fees(upfront fee charged by a lender to process a new loan application) or prepayment penalties (a fee that some lenders charge if you pay off all or part of your mortgage early).

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**
 * OppLoans is a site that reformats itself on multiple device platforms which integrates with a cloud-based verification (internet confirmation) and servicing platform ( step-by-step loan serivicing needs digitalized). "The company's proprietary underwriting model uses machine-learning and artificial intelligence as well as alternative financial data beyond the consumer's credit score to provide a more complete credit picture." -[Opploans wins](https://www.opploans.com/press-release/opploans-wins-2020-fintech-breakthrough-awards-for-best-consumer-lending-platform/)*
